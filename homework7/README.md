# Idempotent solution overview

I use idempotent key is generated by a frontend (in tests I use Postman random generator). 
I think it's more RESTfully solution, because server does not store the state.
Usually we want to have the unique of each order, so I made order_id as primary key in DB. 
I used a simple id - integer, it can be UUID. Or we can add hash of order details to it.
